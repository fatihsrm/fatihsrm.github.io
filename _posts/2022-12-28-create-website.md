Step 1: Get a domain name and URL
It's important to choose a good domain name. It affects:

how easily customers can find your site
how much customers will trust your website and brand
your intellectual property and trademark protection. 

Step 2: Set up an email address to match your domain name
You can use free email services for your business, but using one that matches your domain (and business) name, creates a more professional impression.

For example, your domain-name email will display as info@mybusiness.com, instead of mybusiness@gmail.com.

The service provider who registers your domain name, or your web hosting company, may provide an email service or include it as a paid add-on.

Step 3: Find a web hosting company
For your website to be published and accessible on the internet, it has to be hosted by a web hosting company. These companies provide you with a secure space on their server to store all your website content.

You can host your website with the same company you register your domain name with, or you can choose a different host if this meets your business needs better.

Monthly fees for web hosting can vary depending on how big your website is and how many visits you get.

Step 4: Design your website
When designing your website, think about:

the information you want to give your customers
what you want them to do on your site
the questions they'll have
the order they'll be doing things in.
Structure the site to make it easy for them to find and do the things they need. It might help to look at websites of businesses like yours to see how they've designed their site and what features they've added.

A well-designed and easy-to-use website will help your business stand out.

An easy way to understand what you may need for your website is to draw up a visual site map.

Typically, you'd want a page dedicated to each product range or critical service you offer.

Step 5: Build your website
When deciding how to build your website, consider how it will be maintained and how easy it will be to make changes. You might need to make regular changes to the content on your website, for example:

updating advertising and adding information on sales and special offers
updating contact information
reflecting changes in prices, products and services
updating opening times, for example, for public holidays
changing the look and feel of your website.
Building your website can be a do-it-yourself (DIY) or do-it-for-me (DIFM) project. You can create your business website by:

using a template-based website builder (DIY)
using a CMS to build a customised website (DIY or DIFM)
hiring a professional web developer (DIFM).
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each option will help you decide which one will work best for you. 

Step 6: Add and manage your website content
Once you've worked out what content you want on your website, you'll need to create or buy the content.

Website content includes things like:

images
videos
copy (written words)
interactive tools, like calculators and estimators
landing pages to support promotional campaigns.
Having relevant and professional content and images will help customers understand your products and services and make them feel comfortable about doing business with you.

Just as you might hire a professional to design your site or make a video, you might also want to consider hiring a professional to create images or write and structure your content.
