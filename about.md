## About

### Who am I ?  

My name is Fatih, i am 26 years old.I graduated from Bogazici University last year. My major was tourism administration. I live in Istanbul with my family. I started to learn something about software developing process. I joined this adventure with html,css,bootstrap and javascript. Currently i am learning python. My next target is django. Software is really vast area thats why it is very important to specialize vertically in a particular point. I decided to specialize in backend development. 

### Why Software ? 

The global IT market grew from $8,384.32 billion in 2021 to $9,358.51 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.6%. This is a really good rate despite the pandemic and economic crises. It is said that these numbers will double or even triple in the coming years. The growth momentum is really remarkable. It is said that these numbers will double or even triple in the coming years. The growth momentum is really remarkable 

### Why Me ? 

Even though I studied administration at university, I was a math and science student in high school for 4 years. In previous years, I used to participate in the mathematics olympiads. I am aware of the importance of analytical intelligence for software development and I can easily say that I trust my analytical intelligence. I have developed myself in algorithmic thinking and am skilled in problem solving.I also describe myself as a global citizen outside of nations and country borders. So the software business is very convenient for me. Although I entered the industry a little late, I can say that I will devote my remaining life to software. I hope I can participate in your education process and meet you afterwards.
